# MERN Book Search Engine

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-red.svg)

## Description

This application is a Google Books API search engine. The task for this assignment was to refactor the existing code which had a RESTful API to a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The App is built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.


## Problem Solving

This application can act as a great way for avid readers to find and search for books on the web. This is leveraged through the ability of being able to save books to your account when signed in.

## Learning

Whilst working throughout this project I learned how to turn a RESTful API into a GraphQL API.
